/**
 * The entry point for the Voter bot.
 *
 * The Voter bot itself allows the management of a repository (such as text-based documentation) to be placed into the hands
 * of the community.
 *
 * If a Pull Request gathers more than a (configurable) majority of positive votes, it will be merged automatically.
 * If a Pull Request gathers more than a majority of negative votes, it will be closed.
 *
 * If a Pull Request reaches its full term without a majority of votes, it will be assigned to maintainers to make the final decision.
 *
 * All in all, a simple bot.
